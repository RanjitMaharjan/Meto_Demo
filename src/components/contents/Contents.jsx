                    We use the agile development methodology to minimize risk, such as bugs, 
                    cost overruns, and changing requirements, when adding new functionality. 
                    In our approach, we develop the software in iterations that contain 
                    mini-increments of the new functionality. We consider different forms of 
                    the agile development method, including scrum, crystal, extreme programming 
                    (XP), and feature-driven development (FDD).
